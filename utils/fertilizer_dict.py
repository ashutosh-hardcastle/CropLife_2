    'NHigh': """<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">The Nitrogen value of the soil is high.<br/>
        Nitrogen is used by plants to make proteins, nucleic acids, and hormones. Reduced growth and yellowing of leaves 
        are signs of nitrogen deficiency in plants. Your plants may appear lush and green when there is too much 
        nitrogen in the soil, but their potential to fruit and flower is drastically decreased. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">Please consider the following insights that will improve Nitrogen deficiency:</p>
        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 1. <i>Planting Nitrogen Fixing Plants:</i>
        To remove excess nitrogen from soil, you must bind the nitrogen to something else. Plants such as squash, 
        cabbage, broccoli, and maize consume a lot of nitrogen as they grow. When these plants are grown on soil with 
        too much nitrogen, the excess nitrogen will be used up by the plants. 
        </p>
        
        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 2. <i>Mulch for Removing Excess Nitrogen in Soil:</i>
        Spreading Mulch on soil that consists excess nitrogen, draws away some of it. 
        This works particularly nicely with inexpensive, colored mulch. Cheap, colored mulch is usually created from 
        waste soft woods, and when they break down, they require more nitrogen in the soil. 
        </p>
        
         <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 3. <i>Usage of Coffee Grounds:</i> 
         Coffee grounds have the advantage of adding organic material to the soil, which enhances drainage, water 
         retention, and aeration.</p>""",

    'NLow': """<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">The Nitrogen value of the soil is low.<br/>To put it another 
        way, plants require nitrogen to survive. A plant cannot synthesise proteins, amino acids, or even its DNA 
        without nitrogen. This is why plants get stunted when there is a nitrogen deficiency in the soil. They are 
        unable to produce their own cells. </p> <br></br> 
        
        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">Please consider the following insights that will improve nitrogen 
        deficiency:</p> <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 1. <i>Adding Manure:</i> Manure is rich in nutrients 
        that plants require, such as nitrogen. Proper application is essential for maximising the benefits of manure 
        compost in the garden. Mixing manure with compost is one of the most effective ways to use it as a plant 
        fertiliser. The possibility of burning the plants is eliminated when manure is composted. </p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 2. <i>Planting Nitrogen fixing plants:</i> Some plants are 
        nitrogen-fixing plants, which means that as they grow, they will contribute nitrogen to your soil. Beans and 
        legumes are the two most important to include in your garden beds. They fix the nutrients rather than taking 
        nitrogen from the soil. </p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 3. <i>Usage of Fish Emulsion:</i> Fish emulsion is another 
        nitrogen-rich fertiliser with an NPK ratio of 5:1:1. That is to say, while it provides nitrogen to your 
        plants, the dose isn't strong enough to cause them to burn. Fish emulsion has the added benefit of containing 
        a variety of additional micronutrients that are beneficial to your plants.</p>""",

    'PHigh': """<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">The Phosphorus value of soil is high.<br/> Phosphorus, 
        unlike other plant nutrients, does not seep into the soil. This means that an excess of phosphorus in the 
        soil might accumulate across several growing seasons. Excess phosphorus can be caused by a variety of 
        factors. The most prevalent cause of this problem is the application of manures or non-organic fertilisers on 
        a regular basis.</p> <br></br> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">Please consider the following insights that will improve phosphorus 
        deficiency:</p> <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 1. <i>Avoid adding manure as fertilizer:</i> Manure 
        is often heavy in phosphorous, which can quickly cause phosphorous levels to rise. This is especially true if 
        manure is used to boost the soil's nitrogen levels. Plants can remove somewhat too much phosphorus in most 
        cases, but there is a limit to how much phosphorous each plant can remove each year. When manure is given 
        solely to increase nitrogen, plants reach that limit much faster.</p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 2. <i>Add Phosphorous-free fertilizer:</i> 
        If we consider the format for the fertilizers, it being a string of numbers is "X-X-X".
        The first number represents nitrogen, followed by phosphorous, and finally potassium. 
        A "0" will always appear in the second column for phosphorus-free fertilisers.</p>

    'PLow': """<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">The Phosphorus value of soil is low.<br/> Phosphorus is an 
        essential nutrient in plants since it is a component of major plant structural compounds and serves as a 
        catalyst in the conversion of a variety of vital biochemical reactions. Phosphorus can be present in organic 
        compounds and minerals in the soil. Phosphorus deficiency in the soil limits vegetative growth and grain 
        yield. In comparison to nitrogen, soil phosphorus is rather stable and moves very little.</p> <br></br> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">Please consider the following insights that will improve phosphorus 
        deficiency:</p> <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 1. <i>Look out after the root-zone temperature:</i> 
        Phosphorus absorption is temperature dependent. Phosphorus insufficiency is more likely to occur as the 
        temperature lowers, especially if it falls below 15Â°C. To avoid this, make sure your plants are growing at an 
        optimal temperature, and use some form of heating if necessary. For cold periods, you can bring 
        vegetation-heating pipes closer to the root zone. Check the lowest temperature with a min-max thermometer, 
        even at night.</p>

        The first number represents nitrogen, followed by phosphorous, and finally potassium. 
        Apply a fertilizer that has a larger percentage of phosphorus in it.</p>

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 3. <i>Ensure proper pH for the crop:</i> The optimal phosphorus 
        uptake in plants has been scientifically proved to be in the pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. If the pH of the soil is 
        low, fertilise it with lime or potassium carbonate. The use of pure calcium carbonate to raise the pH of the 
        soil is quite successful. </p> """,

    'KHigh': """<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px">The Potassium value of soil is high.<br/> Potassium is an

        deficiency:</p> <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 1. <i>Usage of Organic Fertilizers:</i> Organic 
        fertilisers have lower N-P-K ratios than inorganic fertilisers. For example, chicken manure typically has an 
        N-P-K ratio of 4-3-3. Furthermore, the nutrients in manure degrade slowly, preventing potassium 
        accumulation.</p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 2. <i>Sift and Loosen the Soil:</i> Remove as many rocks as possible 
        from the soil by sifting it. Minerals in rocks, such as feldspar and mica, will not release potassium into 
        the soil as a result of this. Water deeply to dissolve and flush away the surplus in potassium-rich soil 
        after loosening the soil with a garden fork or shovel. Allow the soil to dry completely before repeating the 
        process two or three times more.</p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 3. <i>Add Potassium-free fertilizers:</i> On the top of every 
        commercial fertiliser package, the levels of three essential macronutrients must be listed along with an 
        N-P-K ratio. Nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) are the three nutrients (K). Use only 
        fertilisers with a low number or a zero in the K position to reduce potassium in the soil, or skip the 
        fertiliser entirely. Plants can typically get along without it.</p> """,

        Fertilizers:</i> You may add potassium to your soil without using potash or any other commercial potassium 
        fertiliser in a number of methods at home. Potassium is abundant in compost formed mostly from food wastes. 
        Banana peels, in particular, are high in potassium. Adding banana peels to your compost pile will aid to add 
        potassium, which is necessary for both flowering and fruiting plants' good growth.</p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 2. <i>Usage of Wood Ash:</i> Wood ash is a good source of potassium 
        for your plants. Furthermore, ashes contain many of the trace elements that plants require to survive. 
        However, just use a small amount of wood ash, since too much can burn your plants.</p> 

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 17px"> 3. <i>Have your soil tested:</i> Potassium deficiency in plants can 
        be difficult to detect just by looking at them, so having your soil tested before adding more potassium is 
        usually a smart idea. A soil test is an excellent tool to assess its health and fertility. These tests are 
        often affordable, but when it comes to producing and maintaining healthy plants in the garden, they are well 
        worth the investment.</p> """
